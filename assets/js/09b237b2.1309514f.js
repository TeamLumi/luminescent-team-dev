No ETA on when it will work again.\\r\\n- After a successful update, please visit a Pok\xe9mon Center and heal to update your save.

Think Sylveon, Alolan Marowak and Mr Rime, but not White Stripe Basculin or Hisuian Braviary. A list of their balance changes, a page of evolution methods, and a chart of their locations will be coming soon. When playing, keep in mind that the special incense items you receive will make no difference during your 2.0 playthrough; it will only matter when the full National Dex Update happens in 3.0. Make your choices with that in mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, this is not the final form of these pokemon we are implementing. \\r\\n- Many have texturing issues that need further adjustment\\r\\n- You won\'t be able to see them at all on the evolution screen \\r\\n- Certain battle, idle or walking animations simply don\'t work (but also don\'t crash)\\r\\n- Many have \\"egg\\" as their party icon\\r\\n- They don\'t make sounds\\r\\nAny bug reports to these effects will be closed without conversation. We figured you guys would want them janky but usable over perfected but waiting a lot longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout further ado, here\'s the whole lineup of our new friends!\\r\\n\\r\\n### Other\\r\\n\\r\\n- 700 Sylveon\\r\\n\\r\\n### Alola \\r\\n\\r\\n- 19-2 Rattata \u2192 20-2 Raticate\\r\\n- 26-2 Raichu\\r\\n- 27-2 Sandshrew \u2192 28-2 Sandslash\\r\\n- 37-2 Vulpix \u2192 38-2 Ninetales\\r\\n- 50-2 Diglett \u2192 51-2 Dugtrio\\r\\n- 52-2 Meowth \u2192 53-2 Persian\\r\\n- 74-2 Geodude \u2192 75-2 Graveler \u2192 76-2 Golem\\r\\n- 88-2 Grimer \u2192 89-2 Muk\\r\\n- 103-2 Exeggutor\\r\\n- 105-2 Marowak\\r\\n\\r\\n### Galar \\r\\n\\r\\n- 52-3 Meowth \u2192 863 Perrserker\\r\\n- 77-2 Ponyta \u2192 78-2 Rapidash\\r\\n- 79-2 Slowpoke \u2192 80-2 Slowbro / 199-2 Slowking\\r\\n- 83-2 Farfetch\'d \u2192 865 Sirfetch\'d\\r\\n- 110-2 Weezing\\r\\n- 122-2 Mr. Mime \u2192 866 Mr. Rime\\r\\n- 144-2 Articuno\\r\\n- 145-2 Zapdos\\r\\n- 146-2 Moltres\\r\\n- 222-2 Corsola \u2192 864 Cursola\\r\\n- 263-2 Zigzagoon \u2192 264-2 Linoone \u2192 862 Obstagoon\\r\\n\\r\\n### Hisui\\r\\n\\r\\n- 58-2 Growlithe \u2192 59-2 Arcanine\\r\\n- 100-2 Voltorb \u2192 101-2 Electrode\\r\\n- 157-2 Typhlosion\\r\\n- 211-2 Qwilfish \ufe0f\u2192 904 Overqwill\\r\\n- 215-2 Sneasel \u2192 903 Sneasler\\r\\n- 899 Wydeer\\r\\n- 900 Kleavor\\r\\n- 901 Ursaluna\\r\\n \\r\\n### Form locations and evolution methods:\\r\\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GTp-J1s9zQ4Pd6n1rMU0_gg0D9lpHR_xKL8nSKbJUxc/\\r\\n\\r\\n### Form BSTs/types/movesets:\\r\\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vn9p53I8O6Br37bvZwLoChlLaVLkUhy447cSlIMTfyA/ \\r\\n(Also, between you and me... it looks like there\'s someone new in the Trainer School.

There\'s barely a single place in the game that hasn\'t been re-scripted. Thank you all so much for your patience.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore you download, however, please read this:\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is 2.0 Alpha, and as an alpha, there are a few things to note.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. National Dex is not included. This remains true for the full release of 2.0 as well - we are hard at work getting it ready, but it\'s fair to say this is going to be one of our biggest challenges to get ready, figure out a proper distribution method, and release something that we are proud of. It\'s also worth mentioning that Sylveon is still not included.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Forms are not included (for the most part). We\'re still working on exefs challenges, so this is a little all over the place. For example, <Spoiler revealedColor=\'transparent\'>Armored Mewtwo</Spoiler> is battleable, but not catchable (obtainable) at this time. Hisuian Growlithe is not in the wild yet due to needing a data restructure, etc. Do note, there\'s a couple of fun forms to find scattered throughout the game, but don\'t expect all of the ones we\'ve shown off, and definitely don\'t expect any regionals.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. You will encounter bugs. Please report them in #\ud83d\udc1b\ufe31support . The main point of this alpha is to get our biggest update yet polished and ready for prime-time. Please back up your saves often.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. IF YOU ASK FOR THE ROM (NSP, XCI, UPDATE 1.3, OR PROD.KEYS) YOU WILL BE INSTANTLY BANNED, NO QUESTIONS ASKED"}]}}')}}]);
