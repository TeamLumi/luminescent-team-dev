# Android (Kenji-NX)

## Installation

:::caution

Emulation with Kenji-NX is not always reliable, if you have followed the guide as explained and you are still experiencing issues, it's not the mod's fault. Please ask in the Ryujinx server for support.

:::

1. Download the latest version of Kenji-NX. ([Download](https://github.com/Kenji-NX/Android-Releases/releases))
2. Open the app, go to "Settings" and then the first option, "User Interface"
    - ![Kenji Settings](/img/kenji_settings.png)
3. Tap on "Install Keys" and select your dumped "prod.keys"
4. Tap on "Install Firmware" and select your dumped firmware.
    - Make sure it says the version of your firmware before installing, if it says 0.0 your keys are likely not installed properly.
5. Tap "Add Game Folder" and then select the folder where your base game is.
6. Tap "Select Updates/DLC Folder" and then select the folder where your 1.3.0 update is.
    - Any other update is *not* supported.
7. After exiting the Settings menu, you should already see your game appear. 
8. Long press the game, tap on the hamburger menu, then "Manage Updates" and you should see the 1.3.0 update.
    - If you dont, tap on the plus button, select your update, select it from the list, and then tap on the pencil button.
9. If you have opened the game to test, make sure to delete your save file before opening the game with the mod. 
10. To add the mod, long press the game again, hamburger menu, "Manage Mods", "Import .zip" and select the Luminescent Platinum mod.
    - Download the mod [from here](https://www.nexusmods.com/pokemonbdsp/mods/1).
11. You should now be ready to start the game. It might take long to load, specially the first time, but if it works, enjoy!

## Installing Additional mods

:::caution

Do not install any incompatible mods with Luminescent Platinum! You will risk breaking your game!

:::

You can find additional mods/add-ons for Lumi in [Compatible Mods](../mods.mdx) and [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/games/pokemonbdsp).

These mods are always applied over Lumi, so to properly install them, you have two options:

If you have access to a PC:
    - The simplest way in my opinion is downloading the base Lumi mod in your PC, extracting it, applying the additional mods over it as instructed in those mod pages, compress the Lumi folder with 7zip, and add that mod to Kenji as explained in the step 10 above. Make sure it's the only selected mod.

If you don't have access to a PC:
    - Using a file explorer app, go to "Internal Storage/Android/data/org.kenjinx.android/files/sdcard/atmosphere/contents", then "0100000011D90000" for Brilliant Diamond or "010018E011D92000" for Shinning Pearl. There you should see the Lumi folder, and inside the "romfs" and "exefs" folders.
    - Most mod installations will ask you to move a "romfs" folder into the Lumi folder. Make sure to select "replace" or "overwrite" when doing so. If your default file explorer doesn't have such an option, try installing a different file explorer.

## Notes

- THIS IS A ROMHACK, NOT AN INDEPENDENT GAME. YOU MUST ALREADY OWN BRILLIANT DIAMOND OR SHINING PEARL 1.3.0 TO INSTALL THIS.
- You must be on update 1.3.0 (Not 1.1.3).

## Is it working?

If you are starting a new game, the language select screen should have a gold background, and all languages except English should be crossed out. Make sure to double check that the EXP Share is off as soon as you have more than one Pokémon. If it isn't, you have a bad install. Once that's been done, you can turn it on if you so desire from the computer in a Pokémon Center.

If you have a currently running game, the Pokémon party screen should have extra options for nicknaming/changing moves of Pokémon. You can also try the EXP Share check.

## Optional

### 30FPS

If your device can't achieve 60fps, you can return the game to 30fps for a more stable experience.

To do so, go to Settings, "User Interface", "Open App Folder", then "sdcard/atmosphere/contents/" and then "0100000011D90000" for Brilliant Diamond or "010018E011D92000" for Shinning Pearl. There you should see the Lumi folder, go to "romfs/Data/" and remove the "globalgamemanagers" file.

### Additional Settings for Performance

:::caution

These settings might help with performance, but also make the game more unstable or not boot at all.
If that happens just revert back to default settings.

:::


If your device can't even achieve 30fps, these are some settings that might help:
    - Disable "Docked Mode"
    - Enable "Performance Mode"
    - Enable "NCE (Native Code Execution)"
    - Enable "Texture Recompression"
    - Enable "Macro HLE"
    - Select a lower "Resolution Scale"

### Obtanium

Obtanium is an additional utility used to manage updates for apps that come from GitHub and similar sources.
Kenji-NX doesn't have an in-built update system, so if you wish to keep your app up to date without having to manually check for updates, look for a guide on how to set it up.
[Obtanium's GitHub Page](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium)

### Drivers

Some Snapdragon devices might benefit from installing additional drivers for their specific CPU/GPU. If you are experiencing issues or seek better performance, it's recommended to try these drivers.

Just research which specific CPU and GPU your device has, and which are the recommended drivers for it.
Then in Kenji go to Settings, "Graphics" and "Install Driver".
